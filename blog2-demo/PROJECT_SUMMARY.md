# Agent Oriented Architecture: Project Summary

## What We're Building

A demonstration of Agent Oriented Architecture where autonomous agents:
- **Discover each other** through semantic search (A2A Protocol)
- **Use minimal tools** to accomplish specific tasks (MCP)
- **Generate dynamic UIs** based on queries (Generative UI)
- **Can be added live** without any configuration

## Core Documents (After Cleanup)

1. **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
2. **AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md** - Required interfaces for all agents
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - How to build agents correctly
4. **BLOG_PLAN.md** - Structure for the blog post
5. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design
6. **DEMO_SCENARIOS.md** - Key demonstrations

## Key Principles

### 1. Minimal MCP Tools
Each agent has ONLY the tools needed for its purpose:
- **Data Agent**: Database/file access only
- **Research Agent**: Web search only
- **Viz Agent**: Rendering tools only
- **Narrative Agent**: Text generation only

### 2. Clear Agent Boundaries
- **One agent, one domain**
- **No overlapping responsibilities**
- **No kitchen sink agents**

### 3. Dynamic Discovery
- **No hardcoded integrations**
- **Semantic capability matching**
- **Emergent workflows**

### 4. Live Extensibility
```bash
# The magic moment
docker run -d new-agent
# Instantly part of the system!
```

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Agent blueprint definition
- Architecture design
- Blog plan
- Demo scenarios

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps
1. Clean up redundant documentation files
2. Ensure all agents follow the blueprint
3. Implement minimal MCP tools per agent
4. Test live agent addition
5. Polish for blog demonstration

## The Blog Message

This isn't just another microservices architecture. This is a fundamental shift where:
- Systems grow capabilities dynamically
- AI agents are first-class citizens
- Workflows emerge rather than being predetermined
- The boundaries of applications dissolve

## Success Criteria

1. **Clean Architecture**: Each agent does ONE thing
2. **Minimal Tools**: No unnecessary MCP capabilities
3. **Live Demo Works**: Add agent, use immediately
4. **Clear for Blog**: Code that teaches concepts
5. **True AOA**: Autonomous, discoverable, extensible

Ready to build the future of software architecture!
