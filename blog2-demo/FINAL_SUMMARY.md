# Agent Oriented Architecture: Clean Implementation Summary

## Documents Created/Updated

### âœ… Core Documents (Keep These)

1. **AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md** - Defines required agent interfaces and minimal MCP tool principles
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Practical guide for building agents correctly  
3. **BLOG_PLAN.md** - Structure and content plan for the blog post
4. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete system architecture with diagrams
5. **DEMO_SCENARIOS.md** - Key demonstrations for the blog
6. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - Quick overview of the entire project
7. **CLEANUP_PLAN.md** - Guide for removing redundant files
8. **cleanup.sh** - Script to execute the cleanup

## Key Corrections Made

### Agent Blueprint
- Now focuses on **interfaces and capabilities**, not implementation details
- Emphasizes **minimal MCP tools** principle
- Each agent should have only the tools needed for its specific purpose

### MCP Understanding  
- MCP tools give agents **specific capabilities** (filesystem, web, database access)
- **NOT** for agent-to-agent communication
- Examples:
  - Data Agent: `read_csv` only (no web search!)
  - Research Agent: `search_web` only (no data access!)

### Architecture Clarity
- Every agent is a **Docker container**
- Agents **auto-register** with A2A Registry
- **Live addition** = deploy new container
- GUI splits into **three services**: Query Interface, Admin, Orchestrator

## Ready for Implementation

The directory now has:
- Clear agent boundaries and minimal tool requirements
- Focused documentation for blog implementation
- Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Compelling demo scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Run `bash cleanup.sh` to remove redundant files
2. Follow IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md to build/refactor agents
3. Ensure each agent has minimal MCP tools
4. Test live agent addition scenario
5. Write blog following BLOG_PLAN.md

The implementation is now focused on demonstrating that **Agent Oriented Architecture is about autonomous agents that discover each other and collaborate with minimal, focused capabilities**.
