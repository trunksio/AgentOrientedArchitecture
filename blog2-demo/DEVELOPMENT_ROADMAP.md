# Agent Oriented Architecture: Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the path from current state to blog-ready Agent Oriented Architecture demonstration.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish core architecture and standards

### Sprint 1.1 (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Issue #1: Standardize agent interfaces
- [ ] Issue #2: Implement auto-registration
- [ ] Issue #8: Extract Orchestrator service

### Sprint 1.2 (Days 3-5)
- [ ] Issue #3: Data Agent minimal MCP tools
- [ ] Issue #4: Visualization Agent pure visualization
- [ ] Issue #5: Research Agent external only
- [ ] Issue #6: Narrative Agent text only
- [ ] Issue #7: Prediction Agent minimal tools

**Milestone**: All agents compliant with blueprint

## Phase 2: Service Architecture (Week 2, Days 1-3)
**Goal**: Complete service separation

### Sprint 2.1
- [ ] Issue #9: Create Query Interface
- [ ] Issue #10: Create Admin Service
- [ ] Issue #11: Implement live agent addition
- [ ] Issue #12: Agent health monitoring

**Milestone**: Clean architecture with proper separation

## Phase 3: User Experience (Week 2, Days 4-5)
**Goal**: Polished Generative UI

### Sprint 3.1
- [ ] Issue #13: Component specification protocol
- [ ] Issue #14: Dynamic component renderer
- [ ] Issue #18: Performance optimization

**Milestone**: Smooth, dynamic UI generation

## Phase 4: Blog Preparation (Week 3)
**Goal**: Demo-ready system with documentation

### Sprint 4.1 (Days 1-3)
- [ ] Issue #15: Demo data and scenarios
- [ ] Issue #16: Blog code examples
- [ ] Issue #17: Document live addition

### Sprint 4.2 (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Issue #19: README for blog readers
- [ ] Issue #20: Integration testing
- [ ] Final demo rehearsal

**Milestone**: Blog-ready demonstration

## Key Deliverables by Phase

### After Phase 1
- All agents follow blueprint
- Minimal MCP tools implemented
- Basic orchestration working

### After Phase 2  
- Three separate services (Query, Admin, Orchestrator)
- Live agent addition functioning
- Health monitoring active

### After Phase 3
- Beautiful Generative UI
- Smooth performance
- Professional UX

### After Phase 4
- Compelling demos
- Clear documentation
- Blog post draft
- Video demo recorded

---

## Critical Path

These issues block others and should be prioritized:

1. **Issue #1** (Agent interfaces) - Blocks all agent work
2. **Issue #8** (Orchestrator service) - Blocks UI services  
3. **Issue #11** (Live addition) - Core demo feature
4. **Issue #13** (Component spec) - Blocks dynamic UI

---

## Parallel Work Opportunities

These can be worked on simultaneously:

- **Agent Refactoring** (#3-7): Different developers can take different agents
- **UI Services** (#9-10): Frontend and backend developers can work in parallel
- **Documentation** (#16,17,19): Can start early and iterate

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Live agent addition complexity**: Start early (Issue #11)
- **Performance issues**: Address throughout, dedicated sprint (Issue #18)
- **Integration problems**: Continuous testing, final sprint for integration

### Demo Risks
- **Unpredictable results**: Use mock data where needed
- **Network issues**: Ensure everything runs locally
- **Timing**: Practice demos, have backups

---

## Definition of Done

### For Each User Story
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Demo scenario verified
- [ ] No hardcoded dependencies

### For Blog Launch
- [ ] All 3 demos run flawlessly
- [ ] Live agent addition impressive
- [ ] README enables quick start
- [ ] Code examples clear and correct

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- Agent discovery < 100ms
- All queries complete < 5s  
- Zero configuration for agent addition
- 100% of UI dynamically generated

### Blog Impact
- Readers understand three pillars
- "Wow" reaction to live addition
- Code examples inspire experimentation
- Sets up Part 3 interest

---

## Team Allocation (Suggested)

### Backend Focus
- Agent refactoring (#3-7)
- Orchestrator service (#8)
- Registry improvements (#12)

### Frontend Focus
