# Agent Oriented Architecture: User Stories Package

## Documents Created

### 1. USER_STORIES.md
Comprehensive list of 20 user stories organized into 6 epics:
- **Epic 1**: Agent Blueprint Compliance (2 stories)
- **Epic 2**: Minimal MCP Tools (5 stories)
- **Epic 3**: Service Architecture (3 stories)
- **Epic 4**: Live Extensibility (2 stories)
- **Epic 5**: Generative UI (2 stories)
- **Epic 6**: Blog Preparation (6 stories)

Each story includes:
- User story format (As a... I want... So that...)
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Detailed Claude Code prompt for implementation

### 2. GITHUB_ISSUES.md
Ready-to-copy templates for creating GitHub issues:
- Pre-formatted issue descriptions
- Suggested labels
- Links back to detailed user stories
- Proposed milestones
- Priority ordering

### 3. DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
Phased development plan:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Week 1) - Agent compliance
- **Phase 2**: Service Architecture (Week 2, Days 1-3)
- **Phase 3**: User Experience (Week 2, Days 4-5)
- **Phase 4**: Blog Preparation (Week 3)

Includes critical path, parallel work opportunities, and success metrics.

## How to Use These Documents

### For Project Management
1. Copy issues from GITHUB_ISSUES.md to create GitHub issues
2. Use suggested milestones to track progress
3. Follow DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md for sprint planning

### For Development
1. Each user story in USER_STORIES.md has a detailed Claude Code prompt
2. Copy the prompt to Claude Code for implementation assistance
3. Use acceptance criteria to verify completion

### For Blog Planning
1. Epic 6 stories focus specifically on blog preparation
2. Story 6.1-6.5 ensure impressive demonstrations
3. Story 6.3 documents the live agent addition process

## Key Transformations

These stories will transform the system to demonstrate:

1. **Minimal MCP Tools**: Each agent has only necessary capabilities
   - Data Agent: just data access
   - Research Agent: just web search
   - Viz Agent: just visualization

2. **Clean Architecture**: Proper service separation
   - Orchestrator Service (coordination)
   - Query Interface (user UI)
   - Admin Service (monitoring)

3. **Live Extensibility**: The "wow" factor
   - Add agents via Docker
   - Auto-registration
   - Immediate discovery

4. **Generative UI**: Dynamic interfaces
   - Agents return UI specs
   - Components render dynamically
   - Infinite possibilities

## Next Steps

1. **Review** USER_STORIES.md for completeness
2. **Create** GitHub issues using GITHUB_ISSUES.md templates
3. **Assign** work according to DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
4. **Start** with Phase 1 critical path items

The system will be blog-ready in approximately 3 weeks following this plan.
