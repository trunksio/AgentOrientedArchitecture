# Agent Interface Standardization - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented standardized interfaces for all agents in the Agent Oriented Architecture system, resolving Issue #1.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Unified Base Agent Class (`unified_base_agent.py`)
- Merged features from two separate base classes
- Added semantic tool selection capabilities
- Implemented health tracking and monitoring
- Added support for capabilities and tags
- Included standard interface methods

### 2. Standard Endpoints
All agents now expose:
- `/agent-card` - Agent metadata and capabilities
- `/health` - Health status and metrics
- `/mcp/tools` - List of available MCP tools
- `/mcp/execute/{tool_name}` - Execute specific tools

### 3. Standard Schemas (`standard_schemas.py`)
Created Pydantic models for:
- `AgentCardResponse`
- `HealthResponse`
- `MCPToolsResponse`
- `MCPExecuteRequest/Response`
- `A2AMessageRequest/Response`

### 4. Updated Agent Runner (`standard_agent_runner.py`)
- Implements all standard endpoints
- Backward compatible with legacy endpoints
- Proper error handling and logging
- Automatic registration with A2A registry

### 5. Migration Completed
- ✅ All containerized agents updated
- ✅ All backend agents updated
- ✅ Migration script created for future agents

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `/agents/shared/unified_base_agent.py`
- `/agents/shared/standard_schemas.py`
- `/agents/shared/standard_agent_runner.py`
- `/agents/shared/migrate_to_standard.py`
- `/backend/agents/unified_base_agent.py`
- `/backend/agents/standard_schemas.py`
- `/backend/standard_agent_endpoints.py`
- `/tests/test_standard_interfaces.py`
- `/docs/AGENT_INTERFACE_STANDARD.md`

### Updated Files
- All agent implementations (data, viz, research, narrative, gui, prediction)
- All agent main.py files
- Backend app.py to include standard endpoints

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Interoperability** - All agents can now be discovered and used consistently
2. **Health Monitoring** - Real-time health status for all agents
3. **Semantic Discovery** - Agents can be found by capabilities and tags
4. **Tool Standardization** - Consistent MCP tool execution across all agents
5. **Easy Testing** - Automated compliance testing script

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all agents comply with the standard:
```bash
python tests/test_standard_interfaces.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy and test in the full environment
2. Update frontend to use new endpoints
3. Add more sophisticated health checks
4. Implement agent composition features
5. Add streaming support for long operations

## Migration Guide for New Agents

1. Inherit from `UnifiedBaseAgent` instead of `BaseAgent`
2. Provide capabilities and tags in constructor
3. Use `StandardAgentRunner` for containerized agents
4. Test with the compliance script

The standardization is complete and ready for use!
