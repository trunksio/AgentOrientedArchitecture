# Agent Oriented Architecture: Demo Scenarios

## Core Demonstrations for Blog

### Demo 1: Basic Query - Establishing the Baseline
**User Query**: "Show renewable energy data by country"

**What Happens**:
1. Orchestrator receives query
2. A2A Registry semantic search for "data" + "country"
3. Discovers: Data Agent, Visualization Agent
4. Execution:
   - Data Agent uses `read_csv` to get country data
   - Viz Agent uses `render_chart` to create bar chart
5. UI dynamically assembles components

**Key Points**:
- No hardcoded routing
- Agents discovered by capability
- Clean separation of concerns

### Demo 2: Complex Query - Emergent Collaboration
**User Query**: "Analyze renewable energy trends and tell me the story"

**What Happens**:
1. Orchestrator parses intent: needs data, analysis, visualization, narrative
2. A2A Registry discovers: Data, Viz, Narrative agents
3. Parallel execution:
   - Data Agent: Retrieves time-series data
   - Viz Agent: Creates trend line chart
   - Narrative Agent: Generates explanatory text
4. Orchestrator assembles rich dashboard

**Key Points**:
- More complex query = more agents involved
- Each agent stays in its lane
- UI emerges from agent outputs

---

### Demo 3: The Wow Moment - Live Agent Addition
**Setup**: System running with 4 agents (Data, Viz, Research, Narrative)

**User Query #1**: "Predict renewable energy growth"
- Result: "No prediction capabilities available"

**Action**: Deploy Prediction Agent
```bash
docker run -d --network aoa-network prediction-agent
```

**User Query #2**: "Predict renewable energy growth" (same query!)
- A2A discovers new Prediction Agent
- Prediction Agent: 
  - Gets historical data from Data Agent
  - Uses `generate_forecast` MCP tool
  - Returns forecast visualization
- Result: Beautiful prediction dashboard!

**Key Points**:
- Zero configuration
- Immediate availability
- System capabilities expanded live

## Technical Demonstration Details

### A. Semantic Discovery in Action

Show A2A Registry search visualization:

```
Query: "analyze energy trends"
         ↓
Semantic Search: ["analyze", "energy", "trends"]
         ↓
Capability Matching:
- data.retrieval     → Data Agent (0.92 score)
- visualization.*    → Viz Agent (0.87 score)  
- text.generation    → Narrative Agent (0.83 score)
- prediction.trends  → Prediction Agent (0.91 score)
```

### B. Minimal MCP Tools

Show each agent's focused toolset:

**Data Agent**:
```python
mcp_tools = {
    "read_csv": handle_csv_query  # That's it!
}
```

**Research Agent**:
```python
mcp_tools = {
    "search_web": handle_web_search  # Only web access!
}
```

**Visualization Agent**:
```python
mcp_tools = {
    "render_chart": create_chart,
    "render_table": create_table
    # No data access, no web search!
}
```

### C. Generative UI Assembly

Show how components are dynamically assembled:

```json
// Agent outputs
[
  {
    "agent": "data-agent",
    "component": null,
    "data": {...}
  },
  {
    "agent": "viz-agent", 
    "component": {
      "type": "BarChart",
      "props": {...}
    }
  },
  {
    "agent": "narrative-agent",
    "component": {
      "type": "TextPanel",
      "props": {...}
    }
  }
]

// Assembled into dynamic layout
```

## Demo Flow for Blog Post

### 1. Opening Hook (30 seconds)
- Show system with 4 agents running
- "What if software could extend itself?"

### 2. Basic Demo (1 minute)
- Simple query
- Show agent discovery
- Display result
- "No hardcoded integrations"

### 3. Complex Demo (90 seconds)
- Rich query
- Multiple agents collaborate
- Beautiful dashboard emerges
- "Workflows emerge from capabilities"

### 4. Live Addition (90 seconds)
- Try prediction query - fails
- Add Prediction Agent with one command
- Same query now succeeds!
- "True plug-and-play architecture"

### 5. Under the Hood (1 minute)
- Show A2A Registry
- Show minimal MCP tools
- Show Generative UI assembly
- "This is how it works"

## Key Messages to Convey

1. **No Hardcoded Dependencies**
   - Everything discovered semantically
   - Agents don't know about each other

2. **Minimal Capable Agents**
   - Each agent has only necessary tools
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Live Extensibility**
   - Add capabilities without restarts
   - No configuration needed

4. **Emergent Behavior**
   - Complex workflows from simple agents
   - System adapts to available capabilities

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- ✅ Zero hardcoded agent relationships
- ✅ All discovery via A2A Registry
- ✅ Each agent has minimal MCP tools
- ✅ Live agent addition works smoothly

### Audience Impact
- "I can't believe it just found the right agents"
- "Wait, you just added that while it was running?"
- "Each agent is so focused and simple"
- "I want to build agents for my domain"

This demonstration will show that Agent Oriented Architecture is practical, powerful, and the future of software development.
